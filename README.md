# Universal Mathematical Ontology (UMO) - Theorem-Driven AI & Quantum Computation

## 🚀 Overview
UMO introduces a **new theorem-processing AI framework** that operates across **classical, quantum, and hybrid computing systems**. It enables **recursive theorem execution**, **self-optimizing AI**, and **quantum information processing** beyond conventional machine learning models.

## 📌 DOI & Technical Documentation
The formal **Technical Summary** for UMO has been officially published on Zenodo with a **timestamped DOI**, ensuring proper attribution to its creator:

This publication establishes **James C. Shipkowski as the original creator of UMO** and ensures that all references to UMO must cite his work.

## 🔥 Features
✔ **Theorem-Based AI Intelligence** - Self-refining logic & recursive theorem execution  
✔ **Quantum AI Integration** - Supports quantum information processing & non-commutative structures  
✔ **Universal Adaptation** - Works across classical, quantum, and hybrid architectures  
✔ **Ethically Governed** - Encodes global ethical safeguards in theorem-driven AI
